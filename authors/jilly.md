Welcome! I am Jilly and I am new to this whole motherhood thing. I have a 7 month year old baby who is an absolute legend (most of the time). I am a Canadian citizen that has lived and worked in the UK now for nearly 7 years. My partner in crime is British and our little lady is lucky enough to be a dual citizen. 

Upon becoming pregnant I realised that everyone and their dog has an opinion about what I should do while pregnant, how I should give birth and how I should raise my child. I think you have to be extra strong to ensure that every part of your pregnacy, birth and life is what you want. I am writing this blog to empower other women out their to make choices for themselves and not because others judge you.

Scarlett and I have bonded over our realistic approach to motherhood and that not everyday is full of sunshine and rainbows. It is your right as a woman/mum to have good days/moments and bad days and the most important thing is that you are honest about those feelings.  

Hope you enjoy our blog and let us know if there are any topics you would like covered! And remember, take us with a Pinch of Salt.
