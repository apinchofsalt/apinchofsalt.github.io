Hi there!
I’m Scarlett and I’m a teacher and new mummy to Angus Herbert Salt who was born on the 13th February this year. My husband is Tom and he works at Bristol Port helping ships in and out of the port. We live in Somerset in a cottage needing more love than we have time for and I am currently on a year’s maternity leave from my lovely job teaching year 2s in a rural primary school. Outside of my work I love to cook, read, listen to music and swim. At the end of a long day working or mummying day I like to light some candles and sit down with good food and wine or relax in front of the TV. Since stopping work I’ve really missed the physical act of writing so after meeting Jillian and discussing our desire to share our experience of motherhood, blogging seemed like the obvious choice. We hope you enjoy!
