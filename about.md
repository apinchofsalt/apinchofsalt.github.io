We are Scarlett and Jilly, just a couple of mums trying to survive. We met about half way through our pregnancies at Saturday morning Pregnancy Yoga. Our yoga instructor (Hazel) was absolutely brilliant and gave us time to meet other mums and find sometime for ourselves. We are both Teachers by trade and taught the same year group. 

After having our babies it took awhile to meet up but when we finally did we had something new in common...we were both realistic mums. There were days when we were down and there were days when we felt we could conquer the world. Upon our second meeting we came to the conclusion that these mums who are happy and put together all the time must be lying (or worse hiding their own struggles)so we decided we should get out honest message out there. 

This blog is all about the good, the bad and the very very ugly. We hope it will help at least some mums know that how they feel is normal and what to expect if you are expecting.
