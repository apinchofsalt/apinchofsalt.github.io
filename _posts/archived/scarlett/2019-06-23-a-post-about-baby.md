cherish every moment, it goes so fast


Angus arrived after fifty-two hours of exhausting and excruciating labour. I had transferred from a midwife led unit where I planned to have my perfect water birth, zoning out and using my hypnobirthing tracks to the labour ward of our local hospital where I was injected with an epidural and stuck to the bed, willing the hormone drip to get me to 10cms so I could finally meet my baby. At 9.30pm on the 13th February this year he finally arrived and my goodness he was worth the wait. People say that the feeling when the Midwife places your tiny human on your chest is indescribable and they are right. Euphoria and sweet relief course through your veins and it truly is  pure magic. 

What followed for me in the coming months and weeks was not so magical however. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t all doom and gloom. I was the first to realise how unbelievably lucky I was to have a healthy little boy but I had no idea the feeling of loneliness, anxiety, exhaustion and loss of identity that I was about to experience. 

The first two weeks were just as I had imagined they would be. Days rolled into nights, we received tonnes of beautiful gifts and cards, ate m and s ready meals full time and stared at our creation who at this point just fed and slept. 

Week 3 hit like a bag full of bricks. Tom went back to work, the beast from the east arrived as did a reflux baby and I was left, sleep deprived and wondering why I ever considered that parenthood would be a good idea. 

I felt sick every time Angus cried. I realised to my disbelief that I had no idea what he needed or how to best take care of him. I was struck by a sense of helplessness and didn’t want to be alone with him. My own son. I hated feeling this way. 

As the weeks rolled on exhaustion continued to build. Angus would only sleep in the carrier or the car and Tom and I spent hours walking or driving around like zombies trying to give him the sleep he desperately needed. 

People would ask me if I was loving motherhood. “Just enjoy it, it goes so fast.” “Oh I wish mine were still that small.” “Rest when they rest.” The more these comments rolled in, the more I doubted myself and my own sanity. Enjoy it? Are you fucking kidding me? He cries all the time, I can’t put him down and we’re not sleeping. Rest when they rest? He only sleeps on walks or in the car and I haven’t mastered sleeping whilst walking or driving funnily enough. The newborn days were crawling past slower than a snail stuck in honey and no to be quite honest I wasn’t enjoying it very much at all. I cried everyday and hated how totally reliant I had become on Tom and my mum. I could NOT do this alone, not one hundredth of it, and that made me feel as if I was failing. 

Angus’ reflux was not improving, I was convinced he was dairy intolerant and I was exclusively breastfeeding, meaning that the night shifts were all mine. I was literally on my knees when, at about 3 and a half months, after one particularly bad night, I had a breakdown. I shouted “I hate my life” over and over again and called my dad to rescue me. I cried solidly that whole day. I had reached the bottom of rock bottom and there was nothing for it. I needed help. Something had to change. 

And it did. 

We started giving Angus some formula to ease the burden on me, we moved him into his own room and we sought help from a maternity nurse. We had to. I was not prepared to feel that way again. Angus is now nearly 6 months and I haven’t been back there. I’m in a good place as is he. 

I hope this blog will serve to explore the way I felt, both for myself and others. I SO wish I had asked for professional help sooner. I wish I hadn’t fallen to the floor in uncontrollable sobs for hours on end. But I did, and here I am, happy and stronger with a gorgeous baby. 

Motherhood is hard, inexplicably hard and it’s ok not to “cherish every moment.” Some moments are utter bullshit.
