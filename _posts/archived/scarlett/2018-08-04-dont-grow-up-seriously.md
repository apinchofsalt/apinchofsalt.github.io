As I mentioned in my initial blog post, in those hellish early days I silently died inside when people told me to make the most of every moment before they grow up. 

I honestly didn’t understand it. Here I was at the most challenging point in my life, all energy gone, zapped of who I was and I was being told to make the most of it. Hilarity! 

A will be 6 months on the 13th of August and I can’t believe what a little boy he has turned into over the last few weeks. He is so inquisitive; picking everything up, eating it, turning it over. 

He makes different noises which can be understood as happiness, frustration, sadness. You name it he’s trying it. And suddenly I’m looking at him, kissing him and thinking ‘one day you’ll be a big boy.’ ‘You’ll probably run away when I try to kiss you.’ ‘You might not want to hug me like you do now.’ ‘You might not reach your arms out to me if someone else tries to put you to bed.’ 

It’s finally dawned on me - I don’t want these days to rush past anymore. I want to cherish the little human who is suddenly embracing the world and loving it. I want to hold onto his little hand and enjoy every moment with him because he will grow up fast and although I’ll always be his Mummy, right now I am his world and that’s just fine by me.
