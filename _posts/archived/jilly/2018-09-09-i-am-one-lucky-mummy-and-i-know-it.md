**I DID IT!** I went back to work full time, travelled three of the five days and we all survived. 

Do you ever find that the build up to things is far worse than actually going through them? This was definitely the case this week. 

I always knew that the first day of work was not going to be the tricky one in terms of mummy guilt. I have left her for a day here and there and never thought anything of it. This was the same. I was itching to come home though and see her cute little face. 

Now Tuesday was a tough one. That was my second day without her and her first day of nursery. I decided not to drop her off on her first day. I knew it would simply be drop her off and leave and that would upset me far more than it would upset her. My main squeeze was a legend. He sent me loads of pictures and let me know how she was doing before she went. I checked the Parent Zone website every half hour to see if there was anything new. It was great when a picture popped up showing how happy she was exploring.

I picked her up and she was having a bottle. She suddenly stopped eating to give me a massive smile. I knew she was okay and she had, had a good day. There was a lot going on that day so she had a very hard time sleeping. UH OH! We have swimming…what is she going to be like? I popped her in the car and she was asleep in about 20 seconds. Thank goodness. It might have been a danger nap but I didn’t care. I would rather her enjoy her swimming lesson. 

So we are home now. Do you ever notice how much you can get done when your baby is napping? I was able to sterilise the bottles, pack her bag for the next day, make my lunch, get dinner going and fill the bottles back up for the next day. You have to be organised as a mum but super organised as a working mum. I always think I would rather be crazy organised so I can spend more time with her. 

Happy to report swimming went well and she was splashing, smiling and enjoying those swimming songs we had all missed.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday…I was travelling around visiting different schools doing training. This meant I had to leave very early to catch trains and I didn’t get to see her. This was a huge wake up call for me. I don’t like not seeing her in the morning. I decided that this wasn’t going to be a regular thing. I want to feed her in the morning and see her even if it is only for 10 minutes. 

She loved going to nursery and she played with all her new friends. As a mum my issue was I couldn’t control things. I knew this was going to be an issue for me! I am glad she is happy but I think some decisions should be down to the parents. I was shocked when I picked her up on Wednesday and they said they had given her ice cream. We had made a conscious decision not to give her anything with sugar in it. I couldn’t believe they wouldn’t ask before giving her that. I know I probably sound ridiculous but it really upset me. When we said we don’t want her to have dessert they looked at us funny. I mean an 8 month old is not going to know that she didn’t having pudding like her friends. I said they can give her nothing or fruit or yogurt but I don’t want her to have these sugary things. We left with nothing solved as they need to check this is okay with someone. Ummmm… it’s not okay with me and I’m the mummy so we need to figure this out. I am sure that next week it will all be sorted but it was the harsh reality that I don’t have the control I once had. But at the end of the day she is happy and settled there so we are going to try to iron out our issues and move forward! 

Thursday was the break down! I got home, was sat with my baby and I just cried. I hadn’t seen her for two mornings, she had developed some eye infection, she had a sore bum, and I felt that had I not gone to work these things wouldn’t have happened. Ridiculous I know! The eye infection couldn’t be helped and I am sure she is going to pick up worse which is good to build up her immune system. The sore bum could have been helped and that is another issue that needs to be ironed out. But ultimately I just felt that I hadn’t seen her enough. I am used to seeing her every hour of the day and now we are down to mornings and evenings or just evenings. It’s tough but it’s the reality of working. 

By Friday I was feeling optimistic because I knew this was the last morning I wouldn’t see her and after this we had two full days together. 

I sat back Friday night with a glass of wine and thought of the week. I had successfully made lunches, house was tidy(ish), everyone was happy and clothed, I managed to express on trains (the looks when you pull a cup out from under a blanket full of milk LOL) and I felt accomplished! 

Although there were ups and downs throughout the week I couldn’t help but think that I am lucky that I can see my baby every morning and pick her up most days. I can go swimming with her. I have two full days a week we can spend together. I am there for dinner time, story time and bed time. There are so many other parents that don’t have that opportunity.

**I am one lucky mummy and I know it!**

I can’t wait to see where our new journey takes us.
