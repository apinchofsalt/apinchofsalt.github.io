Growing up you always hear, “Mum knows best” but how do you get to that point. 

I read my first parenting book “The Contented Baby” a few days before my due date and I felt like a complete failure for not doing it earlier. I took notes and tried to commit all the helpful advice to mind. I then read a book about birth and realised, maybe I should have written a birth plan. So I quickly wrote a birth plan thinking I was only days away from labour….NOT! We had another 20 to go.  

When baby finally appeared (15 days late) I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I asked the midwives:

*How do I change a nappy?*

*How do you know if the nappy is dirty?*

*How to feed my child?*

*How do I know if it’s too cold or too hot?*

*How do I get her to sleep in her cot?*

*How do I get her dressed? She rocked a one shoulder sleepsuit for her time in hospital.*

So as it turns out, mums don’t know best at the beginning but we learn from the people that do, MIDWIVES!

But at some point you are released into this world without midwives and you need to start answering questions for yourself. I wanted to be brave and show the world I can do this without midwives so we took her for a walk. Well, it’s January and cold and how many layers does she need to be in? Once clothing had been decided we needed to figure out how the pram actually worked and how tight it needed to be (we didn’t want her running off). After 40 minutes, we were finally out the door but under all those layers, how do we know if she has a clean nappy? Forget it, we are only going for a short walk, she’ll be fine (this is a phrase I find myself saying more and more). Then she fell asleep on that walk…is she alive? I can’t see her breathing? Should I wake her up to check? The questions are endless and no one really has the answers for you. 

Our second outing, we decided a January shopping trip would be perfect. We arrived, she is crying, why is she crying? I don’t know these cries yet. Right, she needs to be changed! I have located the changing area. I have everything I need….HOLY SHIT! Her **umbilical cord** has just fallen off…what the hell do I do now? Well I had no choice, I wasn’t carrying it through M&S, straight in the bin with the nappy. To be honest I was glad it was finally gone. Okay we have a clean bum, but you are still crying. Okay let’s feed you. Where am I going to do that? Neither of us are ready to do this in public. Back to the baby changing room where I noticed a seat. Okay we have a clean and full baby! I think I got this parenting thing down…for today. 

As a new mum the questions are endless and somehow you get to the point that you know the answers. But normally you only know the answers to the questions you don’t need answers to anymore. Babies are notorious for surprises, whether it’s a surprise poop up their back or sneaky pee all over their new clothes. After 7 months, I’m still not sure I am qualified to say “Mum knows best” to anything but I have a few friends (the Internet) that help me out. I think we get to a point where we know what is best for our baby and blag the rest.
