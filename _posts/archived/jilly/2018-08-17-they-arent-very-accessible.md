I have spent a lot of time visiting coffee shops, clothing stores, restaurants and anywhere else I can go to meet up with friends. Since having my little munchkin, my eyes have been opened to how unfriendly these industries are to people with babies and more importantly people with disabilities. I used to take for granted the fact that I could walk between the racks of clothing unscathed or that I could go to the toilet knowing that everything I need would be there. Now I am in a different world!

There are many shops that may think they have spaced the clothing racks far enough apart for someone to get through but have they thought about the fact that the person may want to look at the clothing instead of being attacked by it. Or that maybe someone may want to turn to the next aisle without having to lift the buggy or crash into every clothing rack looking like a fool. I also seem to come face to face with people who are annoyed that I want to shop with my child. Why shouldn’t I be able to have access to the same clothing as them? I have had to reverse out of several aisles because people refuse to move. I certainly hope that people with wheelchairs or mobility scooters do not have to face this same annoyance from other people. Most shops have a larger changing room for people with disabilities or families but one shop I went into had nothing, In fact I had to go up a set of stairs to get to the fitting rooms. 

My second major issue is toilets. The number of times I have gotten all my stuff together to change my baby only to arrive at the toilet and realise a) it’s locked and I need a special key or b) there are no facilities and I have to use a floor. The key thing really annoys me. Why is it locked? If I had a disability and went all the way to the toilet only to find out that I need to find the key master I would lose my marbles. Who are we locking out? The other day we went out for a family meal and my partner went to change the baby got to the toilets and there wasn’t anything. This happens so often that there are only changing facilities in the ladies toilet. Now this place didn’t discriminate to be fair…there wasn’t anything in the ladies either. So there I was hands and knees changing my baby on the floor. What choice did I have? It is so undignifying and disgusting. I had the task of changing my baby and hoping that she wouldn’t wipe her hands on the floor or roll over. Then some else walked in and there wasn’t enough room for her to get around us. Fortunately she waited outside and didn’t mind at all. But I felt awful for holding someone up and rushed. 

I just think that all stores, restaurants and toilets should be accessible for all people. 

*End of rant…for now.*
