When I got pregnant a lot of people would say, “There is nothing better than being a mum” or “Giving birth is the best day of your life”. Now I’m not sure either of those are true for me. I don’t believe there is a best day in someone’s life, but instead a variety of best moments that make your life better. Being a mum is amazing at times but it is hard work and I’m not sure saying there is nothing better paints an accurate picture. It isn’t all rainbows and butterflies and I needed to remind myself than being a mum is a part (an important part) of who I am now, not all of who I am. 

I think of myself as a good mum even though I do things that others may think make me a bad mum. Here are some reasons I think I’m a good/bad mum.

>>> 1. I went back to work after 8 months of maternity leave (only 7 months with baby). People would question this wondering how on earth I can possibly leave my child and how I can even think about going back full time. This wasn’t a decision I made lightly but I always knew I would be a working mum. I don’t have the ability to be a stay at home mum. I think those mums are heroes to spend all day everyday with their child. I knew that going back to work I would have a social life back, I would work my brain again and more importantly I would enjoy the time I spent with my child even more. I want my daughter to know that she can have a family and a career. It is hard work but it is worth it in the long run. I am lucky that I have a job that I get a holiday every 6 -8 weeks so I can look forward to those weeks with her. 

>>> 2. I have gone on several nights out and I breastfeed….what?!?!? I am so thankful that research has been done to show that women do not need to stop drinking alcohol the entire they are breastfeeding. There is nothing wrong with having a couple drinks and going out. You spent 9 (maybe only 8 months) not drinking and now you want to start getting your life back. Mums need to get out and be reminded that there is more to life than talking in the third person, poop and laundry. It is important to remind yourself of the life you used to have and stay in touch with those friends you had before. 

>>> 3. Letting my child entertain herself. I was always under the impression that you must entertain your child all hours or the day. I have not taken this approach. I think it is important that she discovers things on her own sometimes. Now this time used to be the time I would exercise for 30 minutes or when I would sit down and have a tea or breakfast. She is happy to entertain herself exploring the toys I left out for her. Now I know this paints a picture of her being in another room and me not talking to her. But this isn’t the case. I was always in the same room but I wasn’t interrupting her discovery. Also she is not crying during this time and sometimes I find that she wants to do some self-exploring. If she wasn’t a happy baby I wouldn’t be doing this. 

>>> 4. Not going to baby groups. I tried the baby group thing once or twice and it was great for me to get out of the house but it was more a “Who’s life is worse” than anything. I quickly realised that I needed more in common with someone other than having pushed another human into this world. I need to talk about things that matter to me and the world not just who is more sleep deprived or who has been pooped on the most. I would rather meet up with the true friends I have and talk about real things that matter to both of us. 

When I found out I was having a girl, someone said to me “The best thing about having a girl is that you get to raise a strong independent woman.” This is always going to stick with me. Girls need to be tough to make it in this world and I am going to do everything in my power to make her a hardworking, caring and independent woman and I think that makes me a pretty damn good mum. 

So, what makes a good mum? I think being a good mum means admitting that you need a break to be you, you do things that make you happy and don’t always change things to make everyone else happy. You need to ignore what others may think is right and do what is right for you, your child and your family. But a happy, healthy mum is a good mum!
