After two weeks at home with our new baby, we were finally alone with her. The parents had gone and we were just our little family. I started researching routines because every baby needs a routine or else... You should put your baby down when they are tired but not asleep or crying, that sounds easy enough, NOT! You shouldn’t feed them to sleep because then they will always want food before sleep. But I didn’t want to do these things. I wanted to pick her up when she cried, even if it was just a whimper. I wanted to rock her to sleep or feed her to sleep. But my research came to a halt when I found the following quote:

> **“If the worst thing you ever do to your child is hold him/her too much, too often and love him/her more than life itself – you’ll never regret it and neither will he/she. Life is too short and so is the amount of time for you to do that!” – a wise parent**

Yes! Finally something to remind me what parenting is all about. This quote allowed me to cuddle my baby every nap she had and gave me permission to rock her to sleep. I loved every nap she had on me, no matter how long. Those were moments I didn’t have to move, didn’t have to think of anything else. It was my meditation time. Listening to the little breaths and the little noises and wishing these moments would last forever. 
There were always these little questions from people that would just make you wonder if you were doing the right thing. 

> *So where does she go when she naps?*

>>> *She sleeps on me.* 

> *Oh! All the time? Hmm.*

OR 

> *Have you started sleeping training?*

>>> *No, I either feed her to sleep or rock her.*

> **Judgemental face**

But I kept going back to this quote. I knew that what I was doing was not going to harm my baby, I knew that she would grow out of it and I knew that it was right for us. No one was losing any sleep over it and I realised that although people will continue to ask these questions and judge me, they aren’t experts and only know what they did and they think that is right. 

Based on my knowledge of child development I know that holding a baby, rocking them and giving them your time is the best thing you can do to ensure they are secure in their own feelings. I once heard that you only need to be a good parent 60% of the time and I was 100% sure that holding my baby and rocking them when they sleep would fall under that good parent category. 

After 3 months I was so glad I listened to this quote because she started dropping naps. She was easily distracted by noises and couldn’t sleep on me anymore. She had to go to her cot for her naps. Those perfect moments were over long before I was ready for them to be. I couldn’t watch her dream anymore and I couldn’t sit for hours pretending the rest of the world didn’t exist. That bubble had popped and we were on to the next stage.
