I just finished putting my baby to sleep. The whole time telling her that things are about the change. Tomorrow starts the next chapter of our lives together. I will officially be back at work full time and she will be going to Grandma and Grandad’s and nursery this week. I was sat in the dark feeding her with a tear in my eye saying that everything will be okay. What is this feeling? Mummy guilt is the most awful feeling in the world. 

Before having my baby I always wanted to continue working full time. I am one of those crazy people that loves working. I love learning new things, meeting new people and moving to different roles to further develop my skills set. People said I was crazy and I would change my mind when I had her. After about 3 weeks of having a baby I wanted to go back to work. I missed the social side and I felt like my brain was turning to mush. I don’t think I actually wanted to go back, as I definitely wasn’t ready for that, but I was starting to feel the loneliness that comes with being a mum. When the visitors go and your partner is working, it is just you and a little person that doesn’t talk or move. What are you supposed to do with your time? How are you supposed to keep your brain stimulated? I thought about reading but Twitter was as far as I could go. I didn’t have the brain capacity for a novel. 

But as time went on I started wondering if going back full time was the right decision for us. I went back and forth a lot about this. I started to accept that people were right. I had changed my mind. Until I started to really think about what my days would be like. I would be working longer hours to fill in for that extra day off. I quickly realised that if I worked my 5 days I would have every evening with her, including meals and bath time and we had all weekend together. I wouldn’t feel guilty if I had to leave early because I would be there 5 days. I realised that I am not the type of person that would take advantage of that extra day with my baby. I think I would fill it with shopping, cleaning and all those things that don’t involve us spending the day just being us. I stopped thinking of these magical grass is greener on the other side ideas and started thinking about the reality. I decided that I want to work full time. But can I do it without feeling the mummy guilt? The simple answer is NO! 

This feeling of guilt isn’t helped when you are faced with a nurse at a baby clinic who did not agree with my life choice. Luckily I am strong enough mentally to cope with the conversation with her. I couldn’t imagine if working full time was a necessity and I was struggling with this choice. This is the conversation we had: 

> **How many days are you going back for?**

>> Full time. I have already gone back for a couple weeks before the summer holidays. She really enjoyed her time with her grandmas. 

> **(*Shame face*) What do you do?**

>> I’m a teacher and I work in (said the location).

> **Oh dear that is an awfully long way for you to be travelling. Where will your child be going?**

>> Two days a week with Grandma and Grandad and 3 days nursery. 

> **Oh. What does Dad do?**

>> He is software developer and he works from home. 

> **That’s great. So someone will be around to take care of her if something happens. You should really think about getting a job closer to home in a village school. Then have another baby and you won’t have to work.** 

I had to laugh it off or I think I might have punched her. I left very quickly after this encounter and complained to partner the moment I walked in the door. I thought how dare you! It is hard enough going back to work when you are happy with your choice. 

A few days after I was talking to a friend of mine about this and she told me that her mum said that working full time made her a better mum. This is exactly how I think I will be. I will value every moment I share with her. I will enjoy my day at work but come home ready to be a mum. I will spend weekends catching up with all the new things she is doing. Plus I am lucky enough that I have at least a week off every 6 – 8 weeks. So I think this is a win, win. She will get spoiled and loved by grandma and grandad and meet loads of new friends at nursery while mummy can get her work fix. 

But why do I still feel guilty? I have spent the last 8 months of her being out of the womb (and 9 months in the womb) trying to keep her alive and control everything she eats, sees and touches. I know everything about her. I have witnessed every first. I think the guilt stems from not being the only person to know my child. There will be other people seeing some of her firsts. There will be other people being able to put her to sleep in a different way from me. They will learn things about her that I might not know. But I know she won’t look at them the way she looks at me. I know that at the end of the day when she sees me, she will be full of smiles and ready to have fun time with mummy. 

I can’t help but wonder is this what daddy’s feel like? Is daddy guilt a thing? They go back to work after a couple weeks and miss out on a lot. It is comforting to know that my baby loves her daddy so much and has a great bond with her even though he has worked full time (at home admittedly). I would love to know from daddy’s out there how they feel when they go to work. Can they just forget about their children or do they feel this incredible weight on their shoulders like us. 

So tomorrow if it is the first day back after summer holidays give your mummy friends a cuddle. It is a tough day but if they have the right people around them it will be a good day.
