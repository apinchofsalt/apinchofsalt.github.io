When we found out we were pregnant, we decided to take an antenatal class. We knew nothing about babies. Neither of us had 
every changed a nappy before and didn’t know the first thing about what a baby needs. So we decided to book onto 
[Daisy Foundation’s Daisy Parent workshop](https://thedaisyfoundation.com/daisy-parent/). Pippa was an absolute godsend. She gave us information on everything we needed to know from
labour to birth to changing a nappy. Before we started the course I wasn’t keen on breastfeeding. I wasn’t breastfed so I just didn’t 
think there was any benefit in it and I just didn’t want someone attached to me all the time. But after hearing about the benefits, 
I wanted to give it a go. Pippa told us how hard it is to start but talked us through what you can do about it. We decided I would give 
it 6 weeks and then we would reassess the situation and make sure it was working for us.  

When our baby girl arrived we didn’t get to spend time with her for a few hours and I didn’t get to attempt to breastfeed until the next 
day. (Birth story will be in a later post). So I had to express into a syringe and send it down to the NICU. This wasn’t easy but one
maternity nurse walked me through it. There is nothing like milking yourself after having your baby and then feeling very successful for 
getting 1 ml. I would send every last drop down to the NICU.

Then came the time to actually feed her in the NICU. I had no idea what I was doing. I knew it would be a learning experience for both of 
us but I was faced with a little face and had to try to get her some food. One nurse just assumed I knew what I was doing and pretty much 
told me to get on with it. I was thankful that I didn’t have to experience her again after that moment because I needed HELP! When our 
baby got moved to the Special Care Unit, the nurse helped me out by putting up a shield so I had some privacy. She knew I was struggling and 
introduced me to nipple shields. They gave me a nipple shield and a sterilising bag. I was all set. I put the nipple shield on and 
it was like magic. She quickly latched on and was able to feed. We both felt so much better. I felt like a proper mummy feeding my baby 
for the first time and she had a full tummy. 

*I knew that the benefits of breastfeeding wouldn’t be the same because she couldn’t spit back but it didn’t hurt and it worked 
for us and that is the important thing.*

When she was released from the NICU and we were on the ward I was told the midwives would help with feedings. I took full advantage 
of this. Every time she needed to feed I would press the call button and I would get my 1:1 tuition. The first tuition was literally 
a midwife grabbing my boob and baby and shoving them together. Funny enough I didn’t care who was touching these bad boys, I just 
wanted my baby to have some milk. She was AMAZING! She showed me different positions to try if the baby isn’t latching, how much 
boob needs to go in and how to know when she is finished. Pippa had said in our training that the baby will need more boob in 
the mouth than you think but I was so shocked at how much they do need. What did it feel like? Not nice. It can be uncomfortable and painful.
This is what goes in time. That pain combined with being an emotional wreck makes it difficult to convince yourself that you want to continue with it.
But in time you get used to the feeling and your nipples become less sensitive and your baby becomes more helpful. 

After my two days on the ward I was confident to come home and feed my baby. But when we got home I tried to feed her without 
the nipple shield and I was not feeling great. She was crying, I was tired so we went back to the nipple shields. It was the only
way to ensure a quick latch and for both of us to get through it. They made the feeding less painful and helped to avoid any
nipple cracking. I also used nipple cream every time I fed. I couldn’t think of anything worse than trying to feed a
baby with cracked nipples or bleeding.  

Using the nipple shields made me feel very successful and confident and they helped me keep my baby fed. I don’t think I would have
carried on with breastfeeding without the support of the midwives. Do not suffer in silence. People say that it is natural and it
is but that doesn’t mean it is easy. It takes training for more of you and there are loads of people and groups that can get
you through those early tough days. They are emotion and painful and you need all the help you can get.

So that was my first few days of breastfeeding but my milk hadn’t fully come in yet. Stay tuned for Pt. 2.
