Before I became a mum I would hear about the low expectations on dads, but now that I am a mum I am even more astounded by the low expectations held by society for dads. I have a brilliant partner. He helps with everything and has from day one. There has never been a middle of the night wake up that he didn’t wake up for. People say I’m lucky but I stand by the fact that I chose to have a baby with someone I trusted and I knew he would be a great dad. 

Since having our baby, I have been on a few nights out. Yup. YAY me! On these nights out I have been faced with:

>> Is your partner babysitting? 

>>> *Ummm…no. It’s called parenting.*

I mean we definitely joke about this one, but how can you call it babysitting. I guess my whole maternity leave I was simply babysitting. 


>> Who is watching the baby?

>>> *Her father*

>> Oh wow! That’s good. Does he change nappies?

>>> *Yes of course he does*

>> Even the dirty ones?

>>> *eye roll*

Yes I think it is completely acceptable that my partner never changes our child’s nappy. How ridiculous is that? I think people need to get with the times. I am not going to do everything and nor would my partner expect me to. 

>> Does he feed her too?

>>> *Nope. I’m happy to come out for drinks knowing my child is at home without food. Hope she knows the number for a good takeaway.* (I obviously didn’t say that). 


>> Your partner is so hands on. It’s brilliant seeing a dad that is confident enough to change a baby in public. 

Yup, that’s right it is so amazing that a man can change a nappy in public. 


Essentially to be a good dad you have to change a nappy every now and again and spend time with your child when mum is out. I can just see it now, my partner goes out for drinks and his friends ask, “Who is watching the baby?” or “Wow what a great mum. She changes nappies and feeds her baby. You are so lucky!” This would obviously never happen because mums are expected to do so much more than just the basics. I wish that society would change their ideas of parenting and hold dads to the same standards. Our baby is 50% each of us and we should share 50% of the responsibilities.
